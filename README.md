# UMGExPlugin
UMG Extension plugin for UE4.

Currently only supports being built from source. Only tested on latest promoted branch. It should work with 4.6.1 but I haven't tried it. I plan to support official releases after the official 4.7 release.

Here is an extremely long video showing what this plugin does, taken from my twitch stream.
